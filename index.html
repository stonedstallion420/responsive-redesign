    <h1>Responsive Redesign</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The goal of this assignment was to practice the workflow of redesigning a website. I identified flaws in an
            existing interface, created low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes for various screen sizes, then built a
            responsive website based on those prototypes.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Part 1: Identifying Usability Problems</h2>
        <p class="h3">Picking a Web Page</p>
        <p>I chose to analyze the home page of Yale School of Art based on usability and accessibility standards. I
            chose this website because it made me feel overwhelmed. Below is a screenshot of the website, which is
            linked <a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">here</a>:
        </p>
        <img class="sect-img" src="./assets/original.png">
        <p class="h3">Finding Problems</p>
        <p>I identified usability problems of the web page based on 4 criteria: learnability, memorability, efficiency,
            and its conceptual model. For each problem, I elaborated on which criteria it affects.</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="ol-li">There is no clear hierarchy.</li>
            <u>Learnability</u>
            <p>The lack of hierarchy makes it difficult for the user to determine where to direct their attention.</p>
            <u>Memorability</u>
            <p>The lack of hierarchy encourages the user to look at components in a different order every time they
                visit the web page. Without a routine, it’s difficult to recall what to do.</p>
            <u>Efficiency</u>
            <p>The lack of hierarchy forces the user to randomly search the web page to carry out their tasks.</p>
            <u>Conceptual Model</u>
            <p>The lack of hierarchy provides no guidance to the user for how to navigate the web page.</p>
            <li class="ol-li">Links are scattered across the web page, and links that redirect to similar content are
                not grouped together.</li>
            <u>Memorability</u>
            <p>The lack of organization makes it difficult to remember where a particular link is located.</p>
            <li class="ol-li">Under the “Community Bulletin Board” section, post and posting components look identical.
            </li>
            <u>Efficiency</u>
            <p>It takes some time to distinguish the component that adds a post from the existing posts.</p>
            <u>Conceptual Model</u>
            <p>The similarity of the post and posting components doesn’t let the user know that they’re different.</p>
            <li class="ol-li">Content on staying up-to-date is not grouped together.</li>
            <u>Memorability</u>
            <p>The lack of organization makes it difficult to remember where to go to subscribe or follow.</p>
            <li class="ol-li">Signing up for the newsletter looks like another hyperlink.</li>
            <u>Efficiency</u>
            <p>It takes some time to find where to sign up for the newsletter.</p>
        </ol>
        <p class="h3">Accessibility</p>
        <p>This web page provides significant accessibility. All of the images have alt tags and all of the elements
            have ARIA labels. WebAIM WAVE detected no errors but provided alerts regarding redundant links or bolded
            words that weren’t set as heading elements. I don’t think these are huge concerns, so I agree with WebAIM
            WAVE marking these as alerts rather than errors.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Part 2: Visual Redesign</h2>
        <p>I created low-fidelity wireframes, a visual design style guide, and high-fidelity prototypes based on the
            usability problems that I identified in Part 1.</p>
        <p class="h3">Low-fidelity Wireframing</p>
        <p>I created 3 wireframes—one for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens—that address the usability problems that I
            identified and described how they address them.</p>
        <p class="device">Desktop</p>
        <img class="sect-img" src="./assets/lofi-desktop.png">
        <p class="device">Tablet</p>
        <img class="sect-img" src="./assets/lofi-tablet.png">
        <p class="device">Mobile</p>
        <img class="sect-img" src="./assets/lofi-mobile.png">
        <p class="h3">Visual Design Style Guide</p>
        <p>I created a visual design style guide in Figma that displays the main colors, typography, and reusable
            components of my redesigned interface.</p>
        <img class="sect-img" src="./assets/style-guide.png">
        <p class="h3">High-Fidelity Prototyping</p>
        <p>I created 3 high-fidelity prototypes—one for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens—based on the low-fidelity
            wireframes. For each prototype, I annotated the different elements so that a developer could reproduce them
            without explanation.</p>
        <p class="device">Desktop</p>
        <img class="sect-img" src="./assets/hifi-desktop.png">
        <p class="device">Tablet</p>
        <img class="sect-img" src="./assets/hifi-tablet.png">
        <p class="device">Mobile</p>
        <img class="sect-img" src="./assets/hifi-mobile.png">
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Part 3: Responsive Redesign</h2>
        <p>Finally, I created the web page using HTML and CSS based on my high-fidelity prototypes. The website link can
            be found <a href="https://stonedstallion420.github.io/YSOA/">here</a>!</p>
